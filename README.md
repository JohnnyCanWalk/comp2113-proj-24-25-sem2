## Game Description

  Kevin is a eighteen-year-old boy living on the serene and beautiful planet of Areland, a place where life seems perfect—there’s no war, no poverty, and everyone is content.  However, the turning point is at his 19yo birthday. Kevin’s father passed him a book. It was the heirloom of their family. It was said that it wrote the secret behind this world but till now, no one can open the book. Kevin tried to open the book too. Unexpectedly, the book was opened. A strong explosion mixed with light, fire and thunder occurred. The great energy killed all of Kevin’s family, leaving only Kevin uninjured, protected by the odd book. Desperately, Kevin picked up the book and read the content.He finally knew that Areland is an virtual plant made by AIs to prison their creators. His real identity on earth was Kelvin Musk, a great engineer whom has been working in the AI industry for years. Knowing the truth, Kevin decides to wake up. He needs to defeat the 10 bosses whom are defending this virtual world to get back to the real world.  
    
  Move upwards to reach the finish line. Do not bump into the obstacles made by the boss. Collect energy to use skills to fight the boss/ get a sheild(which protects you from reducing HP if you bump into the obstacles)/ heal(which gives you one extra HP).

  p.s. Sheild is an important skill which helps you to finish the game faster to meet the time constraint!
