## Game Description
  Kevin is a eighteen-year-old boy living on the serene and beautiful planet of Areland, a place where life seems perfect—there’s no war, no poverty, and everyone is content.  However, the turning point is at his 19yo birthday. Kevin’s father passed him a book. It was the heirloom of their family. It was said that it wrote the secret behind this world but till now, no one can open the book. Kevin tried to open the book too. Unexpectedly, the book was opened. A strong explosion mixed with light, fire and thunder occurred. The great energy killed all of Kevin’s family, leaving only Kevin uninjured, protected by the odd book. Desperately, Kevin picked up the book and read the content.He finally knew that Areland is an virtual plant made by AIs to prison their creators. His real identity on earth was Kelvin Musk, a great engineer whom has been working in the AI industry for years. Knowing the truth, Kevin decides to wake up. He needs to defeat the 10 bosses whom are defending this virtual world to get back to the real world.

team members, application description, features, non-standard libraries, and compilation/execution instructions.  
▪ Identification of the team members.  
▪ A description of your game.   
▪ A list of features that you have implemented and explain how each coding element 1 to 5 listed under the coding requirements aforementioned support your features.   
▪ A list of non-standard C/C++ libraries, if any, that are used in your work and integrated to your code repo. Please also indicate what features in your game are supported by these libraries.   
▪ Compilation and execution instructions. This serves like a "Quick start" of your game. The teaching team will follow your instructions to compile and run your game.   

o Generation of random events   
o Data structures for storing data   
o Dynamic memory management   
o File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving data)   
o Program codes in multiple files
